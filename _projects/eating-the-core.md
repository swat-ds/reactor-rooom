excerpt: "A look at how Chernobyl's radiation affected Europe through the contamination of food supplies."
description: "This exhibit provides a look at how Chernobyl's radiation affected Europe through the contamination of food supplies. Using quotes from a multitude of countries, it explores responses to the radioactivity from governments and their citizens alike. Ideally, the importance of food, a universal thread connecting all cultures and transcending temporal space, will allow viewers to connect, at least in a small way, with the millions affected by Chernobyl."
