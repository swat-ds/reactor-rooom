Among the many mysteries surrounding the Chernobyl disaster, one may
come as a surprise. After thirty four years of investigation, the
question remains: How many people have died as a result of the accident?

While this seems to be a simple question that ought to have a simple
answer, this number has ranged from tens to thousands, depending on the
source. In the initial accident on April 26, 1986, only two people died
as a direct result of the explosion.[^1] Following a pattern of Soviet
secrecy, however, this number was not released by Soviet officials until
April 30, and some Western media sources, such as Britain's *The
Guardian*, speculated much higher numbers due to the lack of
information.[^2] In response, Soviet sources reported the first two
deaths and criticized the exaggerated Western numbers. *Moscow
Television Service*, for example, referred to the inflated numbers as
"fabrications of Western propaganda" and a "pack of lies" on May 8,
1986.[^3] Clearly, Cold War-era international relations were at play.
Over the following weeks, reports were varied and inconsistent as the
nuclear disaster claimed the lives of thirty more "liquidators" --
Soviet citizens who worked to reduce the fallout -- who had developed
acute radiation syndrome (ARS).

Unfortunately, the deadly effects of the radiation released by the
nuclear plant were just beginning. In addition to the immediate harm
caused by high doses, increased radiation exposure can cause cancer and
other adverse health effects over time. Many scholars such as those
cited here have conducted studies over the past three decades attempting
to predict the final death toll resulting from these impacts,
particularly the increase in cancer fatalities. Some concluded that the
exposure levels were low enough in the general population that there
would be no significant rise in mortality, maintaining a death toll
comprised of only 30 ARS-afflicted liquidators; others predicted
hundreds of thousands of victims. All sources acknowledge the difficulty
of pinpointing this figure, given the large number of cancer deaths
unrelated to the nuclear disaster and the hazard of attributing cases to
a single source. The 2000 UNSCEAR report on Chernobyl, for example,
stated that "as long as individual dosimetry \[measurement of radiation
dose\] is not performed no reliable quantitative estimates can be
made."[^4]

This difficulty opened the door for more subjective science, as seen in
the large spread of numbers. Thus, pro-nuclear groups like the World
Nuclear Association and the International Atomic Energy Agency could
produce scientifically-sound estimates of Chernobyl deaths that are
significantly lower than those from anti-nuclear organizations such as
Greenpeace International and the Union of Concerned Scientists. To
confuse the numbers further, one of the most commonly cited estimates
from the 2005 Chernobyl Forum[^5] underreported Chernobyl deaths by more
than 50%, estimating a figure of 4,000 instead of the 9,000 determined
by the work they cited. Debate ensued after publication, and while one
IAEA representative defended the number, the U.N. issued a statement
correcting it.[^6] Just as the initial news reports following the
disaster were influenced by global relations, predictions from later
scientific studies have been shaped by outside political and economic
factors.

Therefore, examine the following data with care. Consider why these
numbers might differ so wildly -- both pragmatically and politically.
What perspectives and biases are hidden within them? What do the
organiztions involved have to gain, or to lose through them? What do the
figures lack?

Think about the human effects and stories of loss not found in raw
numbers alone. As Otway, et al. wrote in their study *Risk Communication
in Europe After Chernobyl*, "50 additional cancer deaths may not seem
like much to experts used to thinking of hundreds of thousands of
\'natural\' cancer deaths per year, but 50 deaths, visualised by lay
people as bodies to be put in coffins and buried, is a large
number."[^7] The numbers seen here tell a story of secrecy and
confusion, of geopolitical tension, and of tremendous loss -- but that
story is incomplete without the words and thoughts of those affected. As
Lyudmilla Ignatenko, the wife of a Chernobyl fireman, said, "They die,
but no one's really asked us.... No one wants to hear about death. About
what scares them."[^8]

Finally, recognize that these numbers all represent a snapshot in time,
and that the effects of Chernobyl are ongoing. Low-dose radiation
exposure will continue to be received for "several decades," according
to the U.N., and increased cancer incidence will persist for years to
come.[^9] Chernobyl has yet to claim its last victim.
