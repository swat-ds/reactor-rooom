description: >-
  Although Chernobyl liquidators (clean-up workers) and local residents received high doses of radiation in the direct aftermath of the meltdown, at least 30 percent of Chernobyl's radiation exposure has and will continue to come from the ingestion of contaminated agricultural products. In fact, radioactive food will be responsible for the vast majority of Chernobyl's post-1990 public health impacts, in addition to a number of cultural conflicts and societal disruptions. This project attempts to trace contaminated Chernobyl food products across the world, through both the atmosphere and trade, from 1986 through the present. Using examples from Belarus, the UK, Norway, Turkey, France, and the US, I hope to demonstrate the continuing and transnational political, social, economic, and health consequences of Chernobyl's agricultural fallout.
