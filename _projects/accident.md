excerpt: "A timeline and graphics show the Chernobyl reactor explosion as it unfolded."
description: "A timeline that dives deep into the night of the Chernobyl reactor explosion and the causes associated with it. Starting with the decisions made leading up to the disaster and moving to a second-by-second description of the explosion, this project follows the status of the reactor with graphics that show the weight of what happened. This project hopes to make clear which underlying issues and decisions led to the disaster."

## Introduction

When examining the Chernobyl disaster, a person could point to any
number of different causes. There were social issues, political issues,
technological issues, and others that all culminated in the worst
nuclear disaster that the world has ever seen. The state of the Soviet
Union at the time is important to understand because it put the
operators of the reactor in a situation that only took a few missteps to
cause a nuclear disaster. There was significant political pressure for
industries (like the nuclear industry) to produce fast results no matter
the way they did it. This led to corners being cut throughout the entire
construction processes and officials disregarding safety precautions
under the fear that they would lose their jobs if they didn't produce
the results the Communist Party was looking for.

While the factors that led to the early morning of April 26, 1986 were
significant, the events that happened the night of the disaster and the
day before were the physical causes of the reactor explosion. It is
therefore important to understand what physically happened in the
reactor and the decisions that were made by the operators that primed
the reactor for disaster. Blame cannot be pinned on most of these
operators because they were put in situations they were never prepared
for, but their actions still caused the disaster.

The goal of my timeline is to help people better understand exactly what
happened the night of the Chernobyl disaster. There are interactions of
poor judgement, bad safety precautions, and flawed reactor design that
can all be explored to show how the perfect storm came together and led
to the explosion in reactor number 4.
