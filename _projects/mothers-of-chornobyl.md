excerpt: "A mother suffers not because she runs into the fire, but because of her duty."
description: "In public commemoration of the Chornobyl disaster, the focus is often on male liquidators and officials or on the children of the next generation thus ignoring the impacts on women. For many women, motherhood is an essential part of life, and therefore essential to understanding the full impacts of the tragedy. Here, two types of mothers are examined. The biological mother, through loss and love of children and families, and the Mother of God and her relation to the mothers of Chornobyl."
