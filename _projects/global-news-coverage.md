description: "The goal of my installation project was to explore the scope of knowledge available about the Chernobyl disaster in the week following the explosion, looking specifically at the types of knowledge shared with people based on their proximity to the nuclear reactor site. My goal is to bring to light the disparities in reliable and critically important public health information available between the people who needed it most and the rest of the Western world. The Chernobyl disaster showcases the importance of public access to critical information and the consequences of the lack thereof."
