category: ['travel','media']

excerpt: "Since these earliest CEZ visitations, however, not only has the nature of the majority of visits to the Zone changed, from illegal profit to visitation (both legal and illegal), but the term stalker itself has developed to mean something almost entirely different. In the age of legal tourism in Chornobyl, a striking dichotomy has emerged between legal tourists and illegal tourists, called 'stalkers.'"
description: "This digital exhibit focuses on the differences between legal tourism and illegal tourism, or Stalkerism, in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. It argues that, rather than just having a difference in legality, there is an entire difference in mindset and understanding of the Zone, with  Stalkerism going further than tourism, and even further than an online subculture, in their relationship to the Zone, with their reverence taking on spiritual aspects and an adoption of the land as a heritage land, regardless of their natural heritage."
