excerpt: ""
description: "My project explores how the Chernobyl disaster impacted the younger generation of survivors both directly after and decades later. A vast amount of our class readings didn’t focus in depth on children/young adults, so I wanted to take the small amount that was covered and highlight it in my StoryMap. Furthermore, I wanted the StoryMap to help visually show that the Chernobyl narrative is not contained within the Exclusion Zone and its impact transcends national boundaries."
