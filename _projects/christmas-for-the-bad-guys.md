description: "This project describes how Activision's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered displays the Chernobyl meltdown through fictional villainy. By using screenshots and dialogues from the video game, MWR creates an alternative story that exists post-Chernobyl, one that doesn't honor the lives lost in Pripyat. Additionally, the virtual setting houses tropes that depict Russian culture as 'evil'."
