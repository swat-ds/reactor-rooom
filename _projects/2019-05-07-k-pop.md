title: "Hello Mr. Ambiguous: Ambiguous Representations of Female Empowerment in K-Pop"
category: ['2019']
classes: ["hide-sup"]
excerpt: 'Our project looks at the ambiguous representation of female K-pop groups, zoning in on one particular group named MAMAMOO. We argue that K-pop girl groups occupy a liminal space between gendered oppression and agential resistance, that is, in their performance of femininity, female idols both implicate themselves by the gendered ideologies that produce them, while at the same time, "work on and against" (Muñoz) those ideologies in a process to transform them.'

      bio: "('22) Even before I became a K-Pop fan in 2014, I was always fascinated with the organized structure of music production and circulation in Korean pop culture. For me, what makes K-Pop such an intriguing site for cultural studies is its ambiguous position in how South Korea creates its national brand domestically and internationally. South Korea’s national brand is built on clashing forces of tradition and modernity, Eastern and Western, convention and transgression; it is interesting to see how these forces interact from a cultural studies perspective."

      bio: "('19) I became a fan only three years ago, and I was initially drawn into the fandom because of the stunning music videos and the choreographies. It's like a snowball effect—once I started listening to one group, I kept discovering new groups that I also liked. It wasn't until later on that I discovered that K-pop resonates with a lot of Asian Americans. This made me think about the production of K-pop vs. the consumption of K-pop and what gets translated and what gets transformed. With that in mind, I wanted to see what we would discover if we studied K-pop from a cultural studies perspective."

      bio: "('22) I have always been exposed to K-pop and although I am not a fan of any group in particular, it has been interesting to observe the rise in popularity of K-pop globally within these past few years and the change/lack of change within the industry over time. Only have recently begun listening to MAMAMOO, they have quickly become a favorite of mine and found out why they appealed to me so much after finishing this project."

## Project Description

Our focus for this project will be to consider how hegemonic femininity is reproduced and resisted within Korean society, but we hope that our discussions can lead us to make some inferences, during the conclusion, on how these ideologies circulate and transform when they move transnationally. As we will show in further detail, K-pop is closely linked to the Korean state apparatus and can be a mechanism to disseminate sexist and misogynistic attitudes. Yet, we would like to investigate whether this is the whole story. Can K-pop be a site of agency and resistance against the patriarchal entertainment industry for performers and consumers? Our focused reading of one particular girl group, MAMAMOO, will show the complexities of gendered representations within K-pop. To analyze how K-pop is implicated within structures of gendered oppression, we begin by reviewing existing literature written about gender, femininity, and performance in K-pop as well as discuss theoretical frameworks that can help us think through K-pop’s relationship to the state. Doing so allows us to question whether female K-pop idols resist or reproduce (or do both) the gendered ideologies propagated by the Korean state.
