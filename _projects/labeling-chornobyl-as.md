title: "Labeling Chornobyl as..."
category: ['arts']
classes: ['embed','iframe','arcgis']
excerpt: "In the wake of Chornobylâ€™s release of radiation, there was a crisis of vocabulary itself."
description: "I wanted to see if there was a pattern in language usage when describing a post-Chornobyl world. Language often seeks to rationalize and explain our experiences. The aim of my project is to examine a selection of four labels and determine why these labels have been given to Chornobyl and how they influence our conceptualization of the disaster."
