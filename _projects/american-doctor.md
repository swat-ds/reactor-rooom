description: "This project analyzes the portrayal of Dr. Robert Peter Gale in Western media. Dr. Gale was personally invited by Gorbachev to the USSR to assist with treating those with the worst cases of radiation poisoning. However when looking closely at what Dr. Gale was doing in the USSR, one must wonder about his political motivations for his work and question the efficacy of his treatments."

In the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, one man became known in the
West as the premiere health specialist when it came to treating
radiation victims. Robert Peter Gale was heralded as a pioneer in bone
marrow transplants and his expertise in host-versus-graft disease,
developing techniques that are the standard today. However, his work
with the victims of Chernobyl is heavily criticised and is largely
considered to have had no real effect on the survival of his patients.
Meanwhile, the contributions from the Soviet doctors who were
instrumental in saving the lives of radiation victims went largely
unsung. Although his suitability for treating radiation victims was
questionable at best, Dr. Gale was touted as a hero in Western media,
serving as the figurehead Western audiences crave.

Since Dr. Gale first visited Chernobyl, he has become the subject of
several hundred articles in newspapers all around the world, conducted
countless interviews, and published two books about radiation and his
experiences in Chernobyl. The media has portrayed Dr. Gale
as a leading figure in radiation medicine and nuclear disaster response.
In one Australian newspaper, *The Advertiser*, Dr. Gale is glowingly
described as "an unparalleled expert on the medical response to a
nuclear disaster" and [another article detailing Dr. Gale's work in the
USSR published in *The New York Times Magazine* is titled "The Chernobyl
Doctor,"](https://via.hypothes.is/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/magazine/the-chernobyl-doctor.html) again indicative of the way Western media viewed Gale as the leading authority (Pine). These articles, among others, paint Dr. Gale as the Western savior during a Soviet disaster. Dr. Gale became a
voice the media thought they could trust and a propaganda device, used
to make the USSR seem incompetent and primitive. It was due both to this
media obsession over the American doctor and systematic censorship that
certain individuals were severely marginalized.

A common theme among many of these Western news sources is the lack of
any real credit to Soviet doctors who were years ahead of the Americans
when it came to radiation medicine. In the Australian newspaper article
mentioned above, the author completely omits any mention of the leading
Soviet doctor for radiation treatment, Dr. Angelina Gus\'kova. At the
time Gus\'kova had been working with victims of radiation poisoning for
so long she "developed a compendium of knowledge on radiation medicine
that had no equivalent in the world" (Brown 15). In Dr. Gale's own
recount of his experiences in the USSR, he mentions "\[w\]hat impressed
me the most\...was a system the Soviets had developed for determining
the amount of radiation each patient had absorbed" (Gale and Hauser 55).
In her summary of the history of radiation medicine in the Soviet Union,
Dr. Gus\'kova states this refined system had been developed almost 30
before the Chernobyl disaster. This reality stands in stark contrast
from the way Western news sources were reporting on the disaster.
Undoubtedly there was heavy media bias against Dr. Gus\'kova as the
Soviet government played a role in suppressing the voices of their own
doctors and manipulating the flow of information that was released.

Dr. Gale's presence in the USSR mainly resulted in him becoming a
figurehead for the media to obsess over. Dr. Gale himself has previously
described his role as largely being an observer for much of his time
spent there. In his book, he speaks about his helicopter ride over the
site of the accident, his visit to Kiev (a large city near Chernobyl
that was not evacuated) with his family, tours of Soviet facilities, and
various meetings he had with government officials. The USSR barred their
doctors from speaking to the press, leaving only the American doctors,
who would be trusted by the Western press, to become the dominant
voices. Dr. Gale was given access to different secured USSR facilities
and allowed to visit restricted areas, meanwhile the KGB was incredibly
vigilant when it came to stopping other foreign access to information
(Brown 29). When the foreign press was looking to conduct interviews
with civilians the KGB would monitor everything and undercover agents
would even step in to retort against reporters who were conducting
street interviews (McMullen; Brown 30). With so little access to
information, Dr. Gale became a vital source for Western press, which the
USSR was able to manipulate. Despite all the privileges Dr. Gale seemed
to have, even he was only fed information that the government wanted to
be released, which served to "\[divert\] the media away from a much
larger drama taking place elsewhere\... to which Gale had no access"
(Brown 31-32). The Soviets were able to use the media's unwavering
belief in the legitimacy of Dr. Gale's word to their advantage and gain
a significant amount of control over the narrative emerging from
Chernobyl. The USSR knew that the foreign press would place the most
trust with a non-Soviet figure, and that is exactly what they were able
to provide the press.

The individualism of Western culture was something that was picked up on
by Soviet doctors, who questioned the efficacy of the treatments used by
Dr. Gale. Gus\'kova criticized both Dr. Gale and American doctors in
general saying, "the excellent professionalism of our Western colleagues
is limited to very narrow fields\'\' and "American or British
specialists often have no idea of Soviet, German and French
achievements, to the detriment of their diagnostics" (Guskova; qtd. in
Taubman). This criticism is due to the fact that Dr. Gale's expertise
was restricted to bone marrow transplants, which is not an effective
method of treatment of acute radiation syndrome (ARS). A report
published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection
"emphasised the positive role of medical management in patients with
severe ARS, and the minimal role to be played by bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) or stem cell transplantation" (60). Furthermore,
Dr. Gale was testing new drugs and procedures on patients without proper
approval (Brown). Dr. Gale arrived in the USSR with almost no experience
in regards to medical management for acute radiation syndrome and an
ineffective and experimental mode of treatment. It becomes apparent how
under qualified Dr. Gale truly was when it came to treating radiation
victims and his misleading portrayal by the Western Media.

Even today, Dr. Gale is still perceived by the media as a nuclear
disaster expert and a hero of Chernobyl. Dr. Gale went to Moscow with
the intent to save lives and bridge the gap between East and West, but
was swept up into a larger political scheme of which he had no control
over. While neither the USSR or Western press is free of blame when it
comes to Dr. Gale's over-blown image, the flaws of Western solidarity
and individualism are key issues that must be considered here.
