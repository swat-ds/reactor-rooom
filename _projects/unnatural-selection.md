excerpt: "What mutated creatures are really roaming the radioactive forests of Chernobyl?"
description: "We often think about Chernobyl from a human perspective, but its impact stretches much farther than that. People tend to acquire fanciful ideas about radiation and the mutations of affected animals. In my project, I wanted to explore the truth behind radiation's effect on wildlife and what mutations really look like here. In doing so, I hope the reader is able to view Chernobyl's ecological influence from an entirely novel standpoint."
