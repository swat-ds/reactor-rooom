## Introduction

Music is present in many aspects of our daily lives. Sometimes it is
relegated to background noise while doing other activities; other times
it contains deeper meaning and can be a way to process pain. However,
how often do we actually listen deeply to the lyrics of the songs we
listen to? Music today often tries to appeal to a range of tastes and
preferences to reach a broader audience with a catchy chorus with the
goal of maximizing profits and online interactions, often at the expense
of the lyrics, as in Justin Bieber's recent song "Yummy": "Yeah, you got
that yummy, yum" ("Justin Bieber -- Yummy").[^1] The purpose of this project
is to investigate whether certain topics, such as Chernobyl, deserve a
degree of reverence when put into songs, possible right and wrong ways of
doing this, and how much the the passage of time or proximity to the
event affect the ability to do this appropriately.

## "Magic Lantern Days" (2015)

{% include page-soundcloud.html id=816658165 %}

### [Lyrics](https://genius.com/Mewithoutyou-magic-lantern-days-annotated)

At almost 40 years old, the lead singer of mewithoutYou, Aaron Weiss
from Philadelphia, was too young and too far away to be greatly impacted
by the immediate effects of the Chernobyl disaster. This doesn't mean
that artists like him shouldn't be allowed to make songs about
Chernobyl. They just need to be extra attentive when creating songs so
that they are respectful of the people who were and are still being
affected by the disaster.

Just the mention of Chernobyl in lyrics today helps keep the disaster in
recent memory. As time progresses, people grow less sensitive to the
disaster and forget that there are still thousands of people being
affected by radiation from the explosion. In a conversation with our
class, Weiss also mentioned that the band's use of the "1985 Chernobyl
heart" lyric is used, first, to add a point of connection for the
listener and, second, to remind people of the fragility of everyday
life. Referencing 1985, the year before the disaster, honors the unsuspecting
citizens going through their daily lives. Weiss compared it to the day
before a devastating car crash, the moments before life as it was once
known is completely uprooted.

## "Can't Run But" (1990/2018)

{% include page-soundcloud.html id = 816659401 %}

### [Lyrics](https://genius.com/Paul-simon-cant-run-but-2018-lyrics)

Another American artist, Paul Simon, must reckon with his temporal and geographic distance from Chernobyl, but unlike Weiss, Simon was at the height of his career when the Chernobyl explosion occurred. After gaining popularity
in the famous duo Simon and Garfunkel, Simon---now as a solo
artist---received a Grammy Award for album of the year in 1987. "Can't
Run But" appeared on his next album, *The Rhythm of the Saints*.

"Can't Run But" didn't earn Simon any particular attention for his
lyrics about the disaster and actually flew under the radar for the
album. However, in 2018, Simon remade a collection of songs that he said
were "overlooked the first time around" so that he could have "time to
clarify in my own head what I wanted to say, or realize what I was
thinking and make it more easily understood" (quoted in Leight).[^2] This
again brings Chernobyl back into the minds of the public from a more
renowned artist. The adjustments made to the song add to the erratic,
almost stressful nature that enhance the feelings that go with the
descriptions of the radioactive rain and the food and water that the
residents now have to debate eating or drinking.

## "Jijiji" (1986)

{% include page-soundcloud.html id = 816656383 %}

### [Lyrics](https://genius.com/Patricio-rey-y-sus-redonditos-de-ricota-jijiji-lyrics) (in Spanish)


Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota is an Argentinian band led by a
vocal political activist. "Jijiji" is arguably their best known song.
This is probably in large part due to the song's upbeat tempo that fits
the characteristics of popular songs and masks some of the more serious
lyrics.

Additionally, the fact that this song is in Spanish affects the
perceptions of the song in the former Soviet Union. In Ukraine, the most
commonly taught foreign languages in schools are English and German, so
many would be unable to understand "Jijiji." Alternatively, in the
United States, Spanish is the most common foreign language learned in
schools so the song would be received differently. The lack of Spanish
speakers in Ukraine points out a fundamental difference between the
English and Spanish depictions: the audience. The purpose of writing
"Jijiji" was not for the people directly affected by Chernobyl. It was
to memorialize the event for a Spanish-speaking audience and to inform those who weren't affected by it, using the platform in the geographical location available to them.

## "Sarcophagus"

{% include page-soundcloud.html id = 816657076 %}

### [Lyrics](http://pripyat.com/literature-and-art/bardy-chernobylya-suryvin.html) (in Russian)

Domestic artists are inherently held to a different standard when it
comes to the ethics of referencing disasters into their songs. Personal
connection and proximity to tragedy more often leads to an ethical
treatment of the tragedy because the artists are better able to portray
the gravity of the loss. Sergei Uryvin writes in the Russian Bard style
of playing, which focuses more on the lyrics with a simple solo guitar
accompaniment; these lyrics are often political in nature.

Sometimes, protesters are accused of being opportunists, attaching to
the most recent political protests to further their own political
agendas. While often given the benefit of the doubt, there is the chance
to face even more scrutiny, as artists' songs do not properly respect
the disasters they depict.

Uryvin does this appropriately. His lyrics highlight the cowardice and
corruption within the Soviet Union as well as the government's failure
to act in the aftermath of the reactor explosion. He emphasizes the
sacrifice of the liquidators and further emphasizes that the
sarcophagus, while physically covering the remains of the disaster,
can't conceal those left in the wake of the catastrophe.

## Conclusion

All these songs are part of the broader portrayal of present-day
Chernobyl. In comparing them to each other, the distance from Chernobyl
seems to be the largest contributor to their effectiveness in honoring
the disaster through their songs. The international artists, while
importantly continuing the conversations about Chernobyl outside the
former Soviet Union, are obviously still extremely removed from the
disaster and its effects. The most impactful rendition came from Uryvin;
the proximity to the event allowed for a more impactful depiction of the
unfairness of the Soviet Union's treatment of its people and gave him
more authority to talk about the citizens affected by the disaster.

The reasoning behind this project was was twofold. First, the
translations[^3] are intended to bridge a gap in understanding the
deeper meanings behind certain songs that would otherwise not be
available for an English-speaking audience. Second, it was to discuss
ways to bring awareness to subjects like Chernobyl while treating them
with the respect they require even when personally removed from the
subject itself. Music is a way we can remember Chernobyl and is a medium
that every person can relate to.
