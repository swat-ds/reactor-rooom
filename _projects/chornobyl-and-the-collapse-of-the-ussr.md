category: ['history']
classes: ['embed','iframe','arcgis']
excerpt: "Chornobyl became a part of Ukrainian identity, uniting nationalists and environmental activists in anti-Soviet political resistance. "
description: "This project focuses on the significance of nationalist movements in destabilizing the power of the USSR, and how the Chornobyl disaster was a major factor in inspiring organizing political opposition to the Soviet government across the Soviet Union, particularly in Ukraine where the explosion took place. I also look at Svetlana Alexievichâ€™s book Voices from Chernobyl as a supplementary resource which confirms the arguments of historians' analysis through personal testimony. "
