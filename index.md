How do we study culture?  We invite you to explore students’ analyses of a variety of cultural texts: fashion, dance, online dating apps, museums and exhibitions, reality tv, viral videos, drag, and K-Pop.

In ENGL 79, “What is Cultural Studies?” students work collaboratively to create interdisciplinary methods of analysis for the cultural objects of their choice. Their work highlights the aesthetic, political, and historical ways that we understand “culture” as a lived experience in the world. Their born-digital projects are the culmination of a semester-long class taught by Prof. Bakirathi Mani in Spring 2019 and previously in Fall 2016 and Fall 2017.</p>
